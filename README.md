# Medical Reservations

###### Why are installed the package `python-stubs`?

This package help for some errors in my code editor: `Neovim`, for this reason the package are a complement for my LSP `Language Server Protocol` than I use `Basedpyright`.

###### What is that files?

Those files:

- `pyproject.toml`
- `pyrightconfig.json`

Those are some configurations for my code editor: `Neovim`, to use for autoformat `ruff` and LSP.

##### Create User for Doctors

Add new user, for example I create two users:
| Username | Password |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| DoctorHerrera | admin54321 |
| DoctorPerez | admin54321 |

> [!NOTE]
> Both users set `Staff Status`.

##### Create Specialtys

Go to the admin panel and create `Specialtys` for use then with `Doctors` relationships with DB.

##### Create Doctors

Go to the admin panel and create `Doctors`, the relationship with `Specialtys`

> [!NOTE]
> Dont Forget set `user` that we create early steps.

##### Create Patients

Go to the admin panel to create `Patients`.

##### Create Appointments

Go to the admin panel to create `Appointments`, that model are releated with `Doctor`, `Patients`.

## Why use admin panel instead api urls??

Well if you see the urls available, go to `http://localhost:8000` then you see something similar:

1. admin/
2. api/appointments/schedule/
3. api/
4. api/token/
5. api/token/refresh

> [!NOTE]
> The admin panel allows us to make CRUDS more faster, instead of using requests for the routes.

All routes are protected to have more security, if you able to go urls protected, you need to generate JWT Auth.

- With `POST` `http://localhost:8000/api/token/` - Body `Json`:

```json
{
  "username": "DoctorHerrera",
  "password": "admin54321"
}
```

Once you make the petition, we got 2 differents tokens:

- refresh
- access

### Try urls with JWT

> [!NOTE]
> Once you create `users`, `specialtys`, `doctors` and `appointments`.
> And generate JWT `access`.

Go to `GET` `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/appointments/schedule/` with header `Authorization` `Bearer jwt_token_generated`

- This token was for `DoctorPerez` and get the appointments with this specific doctor

```json
[
  {
    "date": "2025-07-08T03:05:13Z",
    "appointments": [
      {
        "time": "03:05:14",
        "patient_name": "Erick"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "date": "2025-07-08T03:05:29Z",
    "appointments": [
      {
        "time": "03:05:30",
        "patient_name": "Kevin"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

- Get the appointments for `DoctorHerrera`, before we need generate JWT

```json
[
  {
    "date": "2025-07-08T03:04:45Z",
    "appointments": [
      {
        "time": "03:04:49",
        "patient_name": "Kevin"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
